This code is written using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Let's break it down step by step:

Importing Vue.js: The code starts by importing the Vue.js library.

Creating a Vue application: The Vue.createApp() method is used to create a new Vue application instance. This instance represents the root of the Vue application and is responsible for managing the application's data, components, and lifecycle.

Data object: Inside the createApp method, a data object is defined as a method. In Vue.js, the data object is used to store and manage the application's reactive data. In this case, it contains a single property named courseGoal with the initial value 'Learning Vue.js'.

Mounting the application: Finally, the mount method is called on the app instance. The mount method takes a selector as an argument and mounts the Vue application on the specified element in the HTML document. In this case, it mounts the Vue application on the element with the ID 'user-goal'.

In summary, this code creates a simple Vue.js application with a single reactive property courseGoal initialized to 'Learning Vue.js' and mounts the application on the HTML element with the ID 'user-goal'. The application will update and re-render automatically whenever the courseGoal data property changes, thanks to Vue.js's reactivity system.
